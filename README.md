# CSS Icon Exit Animations

### Remember that one time that you didn't want a CSS animation to play when the page loads? But, you did want it to play on hover. And, you wanted a seperate exit animation on unhover?

Oh Yeah! This is how you can do that.

### Run the demo local

* Clone or download this repo
* Setup your localhost (your choice, jekyll, simple http, etc.)
* Run the localhost command in the cloned directory
* Browse to the localhost URL

* * *

### Local Demo Notes

* I am using [Normalize](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/), [animate.css by Dan Eden](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css), [LESS Client Side](http://lesscss.org/#client-side-usage), [Jquery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)
* The CSS is generated using LESS and parsed by the Javscript in the < head >
* The interaction states are cued with add/remove class by using the Jquery in the index.html file
* If you are not running a local server you might get cross origin errors.
